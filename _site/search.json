    "text": "Hi! I’m Ryan Wang, a first-year ScM student studying biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nOutside of academics, I’m also a huge fan of rock climbing (especially bouldering) and working out. My home gym is Movement Hampden. I just recovered from a moderate ankle sprain. Besides that, I also enjoy pop Japanese culture, electronic music and watching tennis. In the near future, I might consider taking up squash or golf—or maybe both!"
